# ETL Scripts (Deprecated)

⚠️ **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: The ETL scripts in this directory have been removed as of November 2024.

## Status

All Python ETL scripts that previously existed in this directory have been deleted:
- ❌ `read_dashboard.py` - Main market data ETL
- ❌ `extract_usa_historical.py` - USA historical yields ETL
- ❌ `excel_com_interface.py` - COM automation utilities (Windows only)
- ❌ `pdf_generator.py` - PDF report generation

## Historical Context

This directory previously contained Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) scripts that processed Excel workbooks and generated JSON data files for the Meridian Universal Dashboard.

### Previous Data Flow

The original ETL pipeline worked as follows:

```
Excel Files (data/excel/)
    ↓
[ETL Scripts - Read Only Mode]
    ↓
JSON Files (storage/)
    ↓
[Flask API] serves to [React Frontend]
```

### What the Scripts Did

**`read_dashboard.py`** - Extracted market data:
- Sovereign Yields (domestic & USD denominated) - Rows 15-33
- Corporate Yields (AAA to High Yield) - Rows 39-44
- FX Rates (currency pairs with changes) - Rows 50-53
- Central Bank Rates (policy rates) - Rows 92-95
- Credit Ratings (sovereign ratings & yields) - Rows 220-241
- Output: `storage/dashboard.json`

**`extract_usa_historical.py`** - Extracted USA yield curves:
- Date headers from USA sheet (last 90 days)
- 13 maturities: 1M-30Y
- Output: `storage/usa_historical_yields.json`

**`excel_com_interface.py`** - Windows COM automation:
- Opened Excel workbooks via COM
- Executed macros programmatically
- Performed refresh and recalculation
- Windows-only functionality

**`pdf_generator.py`** - Generated PDF reports from market data

## Current State

The Meridian Universal Dashboard now operates without these ETL scripts. Market data and other data generation is now handled through:

1. **Backend API endpoints** - Direct data serving from existing JSON files
2. **Manual data management** - Direct editing of JSON files in `backend/data/json/`
3. **CRM operations** - Full CRUD through Flask API for organizations, contacts, deals

## Data Files

Data files that would have been generated by ETL scripts may still exist in:
- `backend/storage/dashboard.json` - Market dashboard data
- `backend/storage/usa_historical_yields.json` - USA historical yields

These files are now managed manually or through alternative processes.

## For Developers

If you need to restore or recreate ETL functionality:

1. **Check git history** - ETL scripts are available in commit history
2. **Review data structure** - Examine existing JSON files in `storage/`
3. **Consider alternatives** - Backend API can serve static data files
4. **Document changes** - Update CLAUDE.md if ETL functionality is restored
