/**
 * Library Configurations
 *
 * This directory contains initialized instances and configurations for
 * third-party libraries used in the application.
 *
 * Organization:
 * - axios.ts: Configured Axios instance for API calls
 * - recharts.ts: Recharts custom theme and configuration
 * - mermaid.ts: Mermaid diagram initialization
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```typescript
 * import { apiClient } from '@/lib/axios';
 * import { chartTheme } from '@/lib/recharts';
 * ```
 *
 * Note: This is for third-party library wrappers and configurations.
 * For your own utility functions, use the utils/ directory instead.
