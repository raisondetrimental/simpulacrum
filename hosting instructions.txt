Frontend:
Your frontend is deployed to Azure Static Web Apps.
The site you are hitting is:

https://gentle-water-0d2bfab0f.3.azurestaticapps.net

Azure Static Web Apps hosts only static assets. It does not run a backend server. It serves your built React application (your /dist output). All API calls are routed out from the browser to wherever your backend lives.

Backend:
Your backend Flask application is containerised and deployed to Azure Container Apps.

Your active backend endpoint is:

https://meridian-backend.yellowbay-aa9a97a0.canadacentral.azurecontainerapps.io

This is running your Docker image that you pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR). The flow is:

You build a Docker image locally.

You push it to your ACR instance (ca57e6c4e3e5acr.azurecr.io).

Azure Container Apps pulls that image and runs it in a lightweight managed container environment.

This backend instance is where all API endpoints should be served from. Anything at /api/... originates here.

What both parts are doing:

The frontend is running static files, nothing server-side, and is responsible for making API calls.

The backend is running inside a container in the Canada Central region and exposing HTTP endpoints at the Container Apps default ingress URL.

How the two are connected:
Your frontend sends requests like:

https://meridian-backend.yellowbay-aa9a97a0.canadacentral.azurecontainerapps.io/api/dashboard-data

When CORS or routing is wrong, these calls fail.
