y earlier shorthand “CBPOL” was the topic label on the BIS portal. The actual SDMX dataset (dataflow) you query is WS_CBPOL. Your workflow should target that.

Here is the evidence and exactly how to pull it.

What exists

BIS’s topic page for Central bank policy rates confirms the dataset and update cadence. 
Bank for International Settlements

The dataflow ID is WS_CBPOL. You can see this in BIS’s portal deep links and in third-party SDMX mirrors such as DB.NOMICS, which list series like BIS/WS_CBPOL/D.CN (daily, China) and .../D.CL (daily, Chile).

Correct SDMX endpoints to use

BIS now exposes a v2 SDMX API with a clear pattern:

https://stats.bis.org/api/v2/data/dataflow/BIS/WS_CBPOL/1.0/{KEY}?{PARAMS}


BIS is the agency.

WS_CBPOL is the dataflow.

1.0 is the current version.

{KEY} selects series by dimension.

{PARAMS} are query options such as format or time window.

You can also use the human-readable topic pages to click Export and copy a ready URL template. The portal’s policy-rates “data” page links to the API and export options.

The key you pass

For WS_CBPOL, the shortest working key for daily data is:

D.{REF_AREA}


Examples

United Kingdom daily:
.../WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.GB?format=csv

United States and Euro area, daily:
.../WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.US+XM?format=sdmx-json

All countries, daily (dot as wildcard for area):
.../WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.?format=csv

You can confirm this key structure from DB.NOMICS mirrors that expose WS_CBPOL as D.{ISO2} per country.

Useful query parameters

format=sdmx-json or format=csv

lastNObservations=600 for a rolling window

or startPeriod=YYYY-MM and endPeriod=YYYY-MM

Examples you can use as is

Daily, last ~2 years for US, GB, KR, AU, UZ, AM, XM

https://stats.bis.org/api/v2/data/dataflow/BIS/WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.US+GB+KR+AU+UZ+AM+XM?format=sdmx-json&lastNObservations=600


Daily, full history for GB to CSV

https://stats.bis.org/api/v2/data/dataflow/BIS/WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.GB?format=csv


Daily, all areas, from 2010-01

https://stats.bis.org/api/v2/data/dataflow/BIS/WS_CBPOL/1.0/D.?format=sdmx-json&startPeriod=2010-01

What fields you will see

In CSV you will get columns such as:

FREQ D

REF_AREA ISO code like GB, US, XM

TIME_PERIOD date

OBS_VALUE the policy rate in per cent per year

The same fields are present in SDMX-JSON under series and observations. BIS’s documentation spells out definitions and historical splices. 
Bank for International Settlements

How to “find” and verify these rates yourself

Start from the BIS topic page for policy rates. It shows the dataset, next and last release dates, and links to the data view and exports. 
Bank for International Settlements

Click Data then Export to get an API snippet that includes WS_CBPOL. 
BIS Data Portal

If you prefer an external confirmation, DB.NOMICS lists BIS/WS_CBPOL with daily keys D.{ISO2} which matches the BIS API key layout.

Bottom line

Yes, the dataset exists and is called WS_CBPOL on the SDMX API.

Use the v2 endpoint and the daily key pattern D.{ISO2}.

You can fetch multiple countries in one call, choose CSV or SDMX-JSON, and set either a rolling window or a start period.

The BIS portal and documentation back this up, and independent mirrors show the same structur
