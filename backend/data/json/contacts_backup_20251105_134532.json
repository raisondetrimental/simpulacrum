They indicated a **max ~USD 15m** ticket, prefer **club-style** participation, and could introduce larger institutions (~USD 100m each) if the structure stacks up. They asked for **Singapore meetings** despite the HK track, and a focused **Investor Q&A** once materials are tightened. Commercially, **payments are timely**, effectively **power-for-cash daily** via NDC. Legally, this will be **Reg S (not 144A)** with documents expected to take **~4 weeks**, **counsel TBD**, and **closing timing still uncertain** pending documentation and scheduling.\n",

GMO, represented by Mustafa Ulukan, positioned itself as a long-term holder and flagged the call feature as a critical issue, stating that a standard high-yield call structure is non-negotiable and that they would likely be the largest investor. TME’s Ganjoloo Ochirpurev provided initial project context, while Meridian committed to updating the financial model to reflect semi-annual Yield to Call scenarios from Year 2 onwards, with callable prices at 104% and 102% in Years 2 and 3 respectively. Aijan requested Kush to implement these changes post-call. The meeting confirmed alignment on long-term investor expectations and flagged the need for further sponsor-side detail.\n",
