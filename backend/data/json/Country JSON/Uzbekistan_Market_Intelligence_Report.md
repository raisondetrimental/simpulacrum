## 1. MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Economic Transformation Since 2017

Uzbekistan has undergone a remarkable economic transformation since 2017, catalyzed by far-reaching reforms initiated under President Mirziyoyev's administration. The centerpiece of this transformation was the September 2017 exchange rate unification, which devalued the currency by approximately 48% overnight, ending the dual exchange-rate regime that had constrained investment and trade for decades.

This bold reform, combined with the elimination of exchange restrictions, liberalization of trade, price liberalization for most goods and services, and removal of mandatory export proceeds surrender, fundamentally transformed Uzbekistan's economic landscape. The reforms enabled full currency convertibility and repatriation rights for businesses and investors, removing a major constraint on foreign direct investment.

### 1.2 Growth Performance

**Table 1: Real GDP Growth Performance and Projections**

| Period | Real GDP Growth | Key Drivers |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 2018-2023 Average | 5.7% | Post-reform surge, favorable commodity prices, strong remittances |
| 2022 | 6.0% | Robust domestic demand, construction boom |
| 2023 | 6.3% | Broad-based sectoral growth, FDI inflows |
| 2024 (Est.) | 6.5% | Strong consumption, investment surge |
| Q1 2025 (Actual) | 6.8% y-o-y | Buoyant domestic demand continuation |
| 2025 (Proj.) | 5.9% | Normalization from post-reform peak |
| 2026 (Proj.) | 5.8% | Stabilization at sustainable levels |
| Medium-term | 5.5-6.0% | Reform deepening, private sector expansion |

Economic performance has remained exceptionally strong, with growth consistently above potential. The surge in growth has been driven by multiple reinforcing factors: significant increases in foreign direct investment, robust foreign borrowing supporting investment projects, surging remittances from labor migrants (particularly from Russia and increasingly from advanced economies), and strong domestic wage growth bolstering household consumption.

### 1.3 Supply-Side Performance

On the supply side, growth has been broad-based across sectors, with construction, industry, and services expanding most rapidly. The sectoral composition of the economy (2023 data) reflects this diversification:

**Table 2: Sectoral Composition of GDP (2023)**

| Sector | Share of GDP | Growth Dynamics |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Services | 43.9% | Rapid expansion in trade, finance, telecommunications |
| Industry/Manufacturing | 23.5% | Value-added manufacturing growth (textiles, pharma, automotive) |
| Agriculture | 20.6% | Stable but water-constrained; cotton, fruits, vegetables |
| Construction | 7.1% | Infrastructure boom, real estate development |
| Other | 4.9% | Mining, utilities |

### 1.4 Nominal GDP and Economic Scale

**Table 3: Nominal GDP Evolution (Local and USD)**

| Year | Nominal GDP (Trillion UZS) | Nominal GDP (USD Billion) | GDP per Capita (USD) | Population (Million) |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 2022 | 996 | ~90 | ~2,550 | 35.3 |
| 2023 | 1,204 | ~98 | ~2,722 | 36.0 |
| 2024 (Est.) | 1,455 | ~113 | ~3,113 | 36.9 |
| 2025 (Proj.) | 1,733 | ~131 | ~3,487 | 37.7 |
| 2026 (Proj.) | 2,005 | ~147 | ~3,805 | 38.5 |

The economy's nominal size in USD terms has grown rapidly, reaching approximately USD 113 billion in 2024, with projections indicating expansion to USD 147 billion by 2026. This represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 18% in nominal USD terms over the 2022-2026 period.

### 1.5 Labor Market Dynamics

Employment rose significantly in 2024, though informality remains prevalent despite recent declines. Key labor market indicators include:

- **Unemployment Rate:** Declined from 6.8% (end-2023) to 5.5% (end-2024)
- **Youth Unemployment:** Elevated at approximately 11% overall, with ILO estimates suggesting 13.8% for the 15-24 age group (2022 data)
- **Female Labor Force Participation:** 40.01%, significantly below comparators (Kazakhstan 65.1%, Kyrgyz Republic 45.4%)
- **New Labor Market Entrants:** Approximately 500,000 annually, requiring substantial job creation and skills training
- **Demographic Profile:** Young population with approximately 45% under age 25, providing both opportunity and challenge

### 1.6 Inflation Dynamics

**Table 4: Inflation Performance and Outlook**

| Period | CPI Inflation (End-Period) | CPI Inflation (Average) | Key Factors |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Early 2018 | ~20% | - | Post-devaluation adjustment |
| 2022 | 12.3% | - | Global commodity price pressures |
| 2023 | 8.7% | - | Downward trend through year |
| Apr 2024 | Trending lower | - | Pre-energy reform trajectory |
| May 2024 | 10.6% y-o-y | - | Energy price reform impact |
| End-2024 | 9.8% | - | Marginal easing |
| Apr 2025 | 10.1% y-o-y | - | Gradual decline |
| End-2025 (Proj.) | 8.4% | - | Continued disinflation |
| End-2026 (Proj.) | 6.5% | - | Approaching target |
| End-2027 Target | 5.0% | - | Central Bank of Uzbekistan target |

Inflation trended downward through end-April 2024 but rose to 10.6% year-on-year in May 2024 following a needed energy price reform. The inflation spike reflects the necessary adjustment of administered energy prices toward cost recovery levels, a critical reform for fiscal sustainability and efficient resource allocation. Inflation has only marginally eased to 10.1% by end-April 2025, indicating persistent price pressures that require continued tight monetary policy.

### 1.7 Poverty Reduction

The combination of growing migrant wages in Russia, increasing migration to advanced economies, strong domestic wage growth, and robust economic growth has contributed to significant poverty reduction:

- **Poverty Rate:** Declined from 11% (2023) to 8.9% (2024)
- **Poverty Reduction Drivers:** Remittances, wage growth, employment expansion, social programs
- **Remaining Challenges:** Regional disparities, rural poverty, vulnerable populations

### 1.8 Output Gap and Economic Capacity

The output gap is slightly positive, reflecting strong growth above potential, though moderating as the economy normalizes following the post-reform surge. Strong domestic demand continues supporting above-potential growth, but sustainability requires careful macroeconomic management to avoid overheating and maintain external balance.

---

## 2. ECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Strategic Policy Priorities

Policy priorities center on cementing macroeconomic and financial stability while continuing the ambitious economic reform agenda aimed at reducing the state footprint and fostering private sector-led, inclusive growth. The Development Strategy for New Uzbekistan 2022-2026 provides the comprehensive policy framework with seven strategic priorities, 100 specific goals, and nearly 400 actions.

### 2.2 Fiscal Policy Stance

**Objectives:**
- Planned adjustment in the broader public sector to keep debt at moderate levels
- Help reduce domestic demand pressures supporting inflation reduction
- Create fiscal space for priority social and development needs

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Borrowing Discipline:** Adhering to external borrowing limits is essential to guard fiscal stability
2. **Counter-Cyclical Policy:** Avoiding government spending procyclicality in response to high gold prices is critical to support inflation reduction
3. **Revenue Mobilization:** Authorities should reverse the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio through tax system reform to broaden the base
4. **Expenditure Efficiency:** Improve public spending efficiency and strengthen public financial management (PFM)
5. **Fiscal Risk Management:** Further efforts needed to improve monitoring and management of fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public-private partnerships (PPPs)
6. **Transparency:** Strengthen fiscal transparency and reporting

**Fiscal Risk Concerns:**

The total PPP portfolio reached approximately USD 31 billion or 27% of GDP by end-2024, with potential commitments up to 34% of GDP under the PPP Program 2025-2030. This represents a significant contingent liability requiring careful fiscal risk assessment and management. The Fiscal Risk Assessment Department (FRAD) in the Ministry of Economy and Finance estimates explicit and implicit fiscal obligations from PPPs.

### 2.3 Monetary Policy Framework

**Primary Objective:** The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) should continue focusing on reducing inflation to the 5% target by end-2027, maintaining a data-driven approach.

**Policy Stance:**
- Maintain tight monetary policy to bring inflation down from current levels (10.1% as of end-April 2025)
- Policy should be tightened further if core inflation or inflation expectations do not decline
- Real policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive to achieve the inflation target

**Institutional Reforms:**
- Strengthen monetary policy communication to enhance transparency and manage expectations
- Improve monetary policy transmission mechanisms
- Adopt greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance monetary policy effectiveness
- Implement outstanding safeguards recommendations to strengthen central bank governance and independence

### 2.4 Financial Sector Policy

**Regulatory and Supervisory Priorities:**

1. **Enhance Bank Supervision:** Safeguard financial stability while reducing the state role in the financial sector
2. **State Bank Reform:** Bolster commercial orientation of state banks and improve corporate governance
3. **Directed Lending:** Phase out directed and preferential lending practices
4. **Privatization:** Expedite and expand privatization efforts for state-owned commercial banks
5. **Asset Quality:** Strengthen asset classification, NPL reporting, and resolution frameworks
6. **Regulatory Frameworks:** Enhance regulatory and supervisory frameworks per FSAP recommendations
7. **Crisis Management:** Strengthen crisis management and resolution frameworks
8. **AML/CFT:** Implement anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism improvements
9. **Macroprudential Tools:** Additional macroprudential measures could help mitigate risks from rapid microcredit growth

**First Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP):**

The first FSAP was conducted and provided comprehensive recommendations across these dimensions. Authorities are implementing the recommendations as a priority to strengthen financial sector resilience and development.

### 2.5 Structural Reform Agenda

**Core Priorities:**

1. **Price and Trade Liberalization:** Complete remaining price liberalization and continue trade opening
2. **SOE Reform:** Phase out SOE support and accelerate privatizations while carrying them out per international best practices
3. **Governance Improvements:** Make further progress in governance reforms including transparency, accountability improvements, and approval of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy
4. **WTO Accession:** Complete WTO accession process to deepen global trade integration
5. **Energy Sector Reform:** Continue energy sector reforms including tariff adjustments and renewable energy development
6. **Labor Market Policies:** Advance labor market policies to address youth unemployment and skills mismatches
7. **Climate Policies:** Accelerate climate adaptation and transition efforts
8. **Data Quality:** Close data gaps and improve data quality for evidence-based policymaking

## 3. FISCAL AND DEBT ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Fiscal Balance Trends

**Table 5: Consolidated Fiscal Position (% of GDP)**

| Indicator | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 (Est.) | 2025 (Proj.) | 2026 (Proj.) |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Consolidated Overall Balance** | -3.5% | -4.9% | -3.2% | -3.0% | -3.0% |
| **Adjusted Overall Balance** | -3.7% | -4.0% | -2.3% | -2.0% | -2.3% |
| **Primary Balance (Est.)** | -2.6% | -3.1% | -1.4% | -1.2% | -1.2% |
| **Revenues (Consolidated)** | 28.8% | 26.7% | 26.5% | 26.3% | 26.4% |
| **Revenues (Adjusted)** | 27.7% | 25.9% | 25.5% | 25.3% | 25.5% |
| **Expenditures (Consolidated)** | 32.3% | 31.6% | 29.7% | 29.3% | 29.4% |
| **Expenditures (Adjusted)** | 31.3% | 29.9% | 27.8% | 27.3% | 27.8% |
| **Policy-Based Lending** | 0.1% | 0.9% | 0.9% | 1.0% | 0.7% |

The consolidated fiscal deficit narrowed significantly by 1.7 percentage points to 3.2% of GDP in 2024, largely through growth-friendly expenditure measures. The adjusted fiscal balance (excluding financing operations) shows even stronger consolidation, improving from -4.0% (2023) to -2.3% (2024).

### 3.2 Revenue Performance and Challenges

A concerning trend is the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which has fallen from 27.7% (2022) to 25.5% (2024) on an adjusted basis. This decline needs reversing to create fiscal space for priority social and development needs.

**Revenue Enhancement Priorities:**
- Broaden the tax base through comprehensive tax reform
- Improve tax administration and compliance
- Rationalize tax exemptions and incentives
- Enhance customs revenue collection
- Develop non-tax revenue sources

### 3.3 Expenditure Composition and Efficiency

While expenditure-to-GDP ratios have declined, driven largely by fiscal consolidation efforts, there is significant room to improve expenditure efficiency. The government has implemented growth-friendly expenditure measures, focusing resources on productive investment and social priorities while containing current spending growth.

Policy-based lending adds between 0.7-1.0% of GDP annually, representing quasi-fiscal operations that support strategic sectors but require careful management and transparency.

### 3.4 Public Debt Sustainability

**Table 6: Public Debt Indicators (% of GDP)**

| Indicator | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 (Est.) | 2025 (Proj.) | 2026 (Proj.) |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Public Debt** | 30.5% | 32.2% | 32.6% | 33.3% | 33.2% |
| **External Debt** | 49.2% | 54.5% | 56.2% | 55.4% | 55.2% |

Public debt remains moderate and manageable at approximately 33% of GDP through the projection period. However, this headline figure understates fiscal risks due to significant contingent liabilities from PPPs (approximately 27% of GDP) and SOEs.

**Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) Findings:**

- **Risk Rating:** Moderate
- **Overall Assessment:** Debt assessed as sustainable with moderate risks
- **Key Vulnerabilities:** Contingent liabilities from PPPs (27% GDP with potential up to 34%) and SOEs; commodity price sensitivity (gold, cotton, gas); exchange rate depreciation risk given external debt share
- **Mitigating Factors:** Strong multilateral support, continued reform momentum, ample international reserves, moderate baseline debt levels
- **Stress Test Binding Constraints:** Commodity price shocks, tighter external financing, contingent liability materialization, slower growth from reform delays, exchange rate depreciation

### 3.5 External Debt Profile

External debt has risen from 49.2% of GDP (2022) to 56.2% (2024), stabilizing around 55% through 2026. The external debt comprises a mix of multilateral, bilateral, and commercial financing sources.

**Sovereign Credit Ratings:**
- **Moody's:** Ba3 (stable outlook)
- **Standard & Poor's:** BB- (stable outlook)
- **Fitch:** BB (stable outlook)

These sub-investment grade but improving ratings reflect Uzbekistan's reform progress, moderate debt levels, and growth potential, while acknowledging remaining challenges in governance, institutional capacity, and structural transformation.

### 3.6 Debt Financing and Market Access

Uzbekistan benefits from strong multilateral support for concessional and market-based financing from:
- International Monetary Fund (IMF) - technical assistance
- World Bank - infrastructure and development programs
- Asian Development Bank (ADB) - infrastructure and policy lending
- European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) - project finance and policy dialogue
- Islamic Development Bank and other bilateral lenders

The PPP Program 2025-2030 envisages significant infrastructure financing needs, potentially requiring increased sovereign bond issuance in international markets as creditworthiness continues to improve.

### 3.7 Fiscal Rules and Frameworks

**Borrowing Limits:** Authorities maintain external borrowing limits to guard fiscal stability. Adhering to these limits is essential for maintaining debt sustainability and market confidence.

**PPP Commitment Caps:** The government caps annual PPP budget commitments to prevent excessive accumulation of contingent liabilities, recognizing the fiscal risks from the large and growing PPP portfolio.

**Fiscal Framework Objectives:**
- Keep debt at moderate levels while accommodating development needs
- Ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term
- Create fiscal space for priority social and development spending
- Manage fiscal risks from SOEs and PPPs

## 4. EXTERNAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE

### 4.1 Current Account Balance

**Table 7: Current Account Trends (% of GDP)**

| Year | Current Account Balance | Key Drivers |
|------|------------------------|-------------|
| 2022 | -3.2% | Moderate deficit, commodity export support |
| 2023 | -7.6% | Widened due to one-off import spike |
| 2024 | -5.0% | Narrowed by 2.6 ppts - strong improvement |
| 2025 (Proj.) | -5.0% | Stable at sustainable level |
| 2026 (Proj.) | -4.8% | Marginal improvement continuing |

The current account deficit narrowed significantly by 2.6 percentage points to approximately 5.0% of GDP in 2024, reversing the 2023 widening. This improvement was driven by multiple factors:

1. **Strong Remittances:** Growing migrant wages in Russia and increasing migration to advanced economies supported robust remittance inflows
2. **Non-Gold Export Growth:** Rapidly growing non-gold exports reflecting economic diversification (textiles, pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, chemicals, processed foods)
3. **Favorable Commodity Prices:** Supportive prices for key exports (gold, cotton, natural gas, copper)
4. **Import Normalization:** Unwinding of the one-off import spike that occurred in 2023

The external current account deficit is foreseen to stay at or slightly below 5% of GDP over 2025-2026, representing a sustainable level given the economy's investment needs and growth dynamics.

### 4.2 Trade Performance and Integration

**Trade-to-GDP Ratio:** Reached approximately 61% in 2024, up from doubling since 2017, reflecting growing integration into global and regional value chains.

**Export Composition:**
- **Commodities:** Gold (largest export), cotton fiber and yarn, natural gas, copper
- **Manufacturing:** Textiles and garments, processed foods, chemicals, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals
- **Services:** Tourism (growing), transport services, business services

**Trade Partners:**
- Major partners include Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Turkey, European Union
- Regional integration improving with Central Asian neighbors
- WTO accession process underway to deepen global trade integration

### 4.3 International Reserves

International reserves have remained ample throughout the reform period, providing a strong buffer against external shocks. While specific reserve levels are not detailed in the available data, reserves are projected to remain adequate at **9.2 months of imports by end-2026**, well above standard adequacy thresholds.

**Table 8: Reserve Adequacy Metrics**

| Metric | Status | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Import Coverage | 9.2 months (2026 proj.) | Well above 3-month minimum threshold |
| ARA Framework | Characterized as ample | Meets adequacy benchmarks |
| Trend | Stable and adequate | Supportive of exchange rate flexibility |

The ample reserve position supports the flexible exchange rate regime, provides confidence to investors, and enables the CBU to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility if needed while maintaining the floating exchange rate system.

### 4.4 Exchange Rate Regime and Performance

**Table 9: Exchange Rate Developments**

| Indicator | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Trend |
|-----------|------|------|------|-------|
| **Nominal Rate (UZS per USD, end-period)** | 11,225 | 12,339 | 12,920 | Gradual depreciation |
| **Real Effective Exchange Rate (2015=100)** | 61.8 | 58.8 | 55.4 | Real depreciation |
| **Regime** | De facto floating | De facto floating | De facto floating | Maintained flexibility |

Uzbekistan operates a **de facto floating exchange rate regime** since the historic 2017 currency liberalization. The nominal exchange rate has depreciated gradually against the USD, from 11,225 (2022) to 12,920 (2024), representing approximately 15% cumulative depreciation over the period.

The real effective exchange rate has also depreciated, falling from 61.8 (2022) to 55.4 (2024) on a 2015=100 basis. This real depreciation supports export competitiveness and external balance adjustment.

**Policy Recommendations:** Authorities are encouraged to adopt even greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance monetary policy effectiveness and facilitate external adjustment.

### 4.5 FX Convertibility and Capital Account Openness

The 2017 currency liberalization represents one of Uzbekistan's most significant reform achievements. The reform package included:

1. **Exchange Rate Unification:** Devaluation of approximately 48% overnight, ending the dual exchange-rate regime
2. **Full Convertibility:** Free conversion and repatriation of foreign currency for businesses and investors
3. **Elimination of Export Surrender Requirements:** Ending mandatory surrender of export proceeds
4. **No Capital Controls:** Free movement of capital for investment purposes

**Current Status:** Very low convertibility risk. The economy is fully liberalized for currency transactions with no capital controls. However, FX volatility risk remains moderate given the continued depreciation trend and limited availability of local currency hedging instruments for very large transactions.

---

## 5. MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR

### 5.1 Monetary Policy Implementation

The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) maintains a data-driven monetary policy approach focused on achieving the 5% inflation target by end-2027. The policy stance remains appropriately tight given current inflation levels of approximately 10%, but further tightening may be necessary if core inflation or inflation expectations do not decline as projected.

**Table 10: Monetary Aggregates Growth**

| Indicator | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 (Proj.) | 2026 (Proj.) |
|-----------|------|------|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Credit to Economy** | 21.4% | 23.2% | 4.0% | 19.3% | 16.0% |
| **Broad Money** | 30.2% | 12.2% | 30.6% | 19.4% | 16.3% |
| **Reserve Money** | 31.4% | 4.9% | 9.5% | 9.2% | 8.8% |

Credit to the economy experienced rapid growth in 2022-2023 (21-23% annually) before a sharp slowdown to just 4.0% in 2024, likely reflecting the tightening of monetary conditions. Credit growth is projected to reaccelerate to 19.3% (2025) and 16.0% (2026) as monetary policy normalizes and financial deepening continues.

Broad money growth has been volatile, ranging from 12.2% (2023) to 30.6% (2024), while reserve money growth has moderated to single digits, consistent with the CBU's inflation-fighting stance.

### 5.2 Real Policy Rates

With inflation at 9.8-10.6% and the CBU maintaining a tight monetary stance, real policy rates are positive but need careful monitoring to ensure they remain adequately restrictive to achieve the inflation target of 5% by end-2027. The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanisms is gradually improving but remains an area requiring continued institutional development.

### 5.3 Banking Sector Structure and Performance

**Capitalization:** The banking sector remains well-capitalized, though specific Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) metrics are not detailed in available excerpts. The sector is characterized as sound from a capital perspective.

**Profitability:** Banking sector profitability is sound, with positive Return on Equity (ROE), though specific metrics are not quantified in the available data.

**Liquidity:** Liquidity is characterized as adequate, with the banking sector maintaining sound liquidity coverage.

**Asset Quality:** Asset classification and NPL reporting need strengthening per FSAP recommendations. While specific Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios are not quantified, the banking sector is characterized as sound overall. Authorities have been advised to strengthen NPL resolution frameworks and improve asset quality monitoring.

### 5.4 Banking Sector Challenges and Reforms

**State Footprint:** The economy continues to be dominated by large state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), though gradual privatization is underway. The state bank dominance creates challenges:
- Market distortions and limited competition
- Directed and preferential lending practices
- Weak commercial orientation
- Potential fiscal contingent liabilities

**Reform Priorities:**
1. **Privatization:** Expedite and expand privatization of state banks following international best practices
2. **Commercial Orientation:** Bolster commercial orientation and strengthen corporate governance
3. **Phase Out Directed Lending:** Eliminate directed and preferential lending practices
4. **Strengthen Supervision:** Enhance regulatory and supervisory frameworks per FSAP
5. **Crisis Management:** Develop robust crisis management and bank resolution frameworks
6. **AML/CFT:** Strengthen anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism frameworks

### 5.5 Microcredit Sector Risks

The microcredit sector is experiencing rapid growth, creating both financial inclusion opportunities and financial stability risks. Additional macroprudential measures could help mitigate risks from this rapid expansion, including:
- Borrower protection frameworks
- Responsible lending standards
- Provisioning and capital requirements
- Supervisory capacity for non-bank financial institutions

### 5.6 Capital Markets Development

**Current State:** Domestic capital markets remain underdeveloped and shallow. The specific local bond market size as a percentage of GDP is not provided, but the market is characterized as nascent.

**Development Strategy:** A Capital Markets Development Strategy was adopted in 2021 with EBRD support, aiming to deepen markets and provide alternative financing channels. Key elements include:
- Development of equity markets
- Corporate and municipal bond market development
- Regulatory framework enhancement
- Investor base development
- Infrastructure (trading systems, clearance and settlement, custody)

**Progress:** Limited progress to date. Credit to the economy is growing from a relatively low base, the banking sector remains concentrated, and the bond market is nascent. EBRD's equity investment in TBC Bank (Uzbekistan's first fully digital bank) represents one of the few equity market development initiatives.

### 5.7 Currency and Hedging Markets

**Local Currency Hedging Depth:** Limited. While Uzbekistan has achieved full currency convertibility, the depth of local currency hedging instruments remains shallow. Major projects are typically USD-denominated to avoid currency risk.

**Hedging Solutions:** EBRD has provided hedging support, including a USD 20 million cross-currency swap for clients to facilitate currency risk management. Further development of FX derivatives markets is needed to support domestic currency financing and reduce dollarization.

**Dollarization:** Not specifically quantified in available data. Currency liberalization and free convertibility suggest lower dollarization than historically, but the limited hedging market and preference for USD-denominated contracts in large projects indicate continued dollarization in certain segments.

### 5.8 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)

The **first Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)** was conducted jointly by the IMF and World Bank, providing comprehensive recommendations across multiple dimensions:

1. **Bank Supervision and Regulation:** Enhance supervisory capacity, frameworks, and enforcement
2. **Asset Classification:** Strengthen asset classification standards
3. **NPL Frameworks:** Improve NPL reporting and resolution mechanisms
4. **Regulatory Frameworks:** Modernize prudential regulations aligned with international standards
5. **Crisis Management:** Develop crisis management, resolution, and deposit insurance frameworks
6. **AML/CFT:** Strengthen anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism
7. **Macroprudential Policy:** Adopt macroprudential measures, particularly for microcredit risks
8. **State Bank Governance:** Improve commercial orientation and governance of state banks
9. **Directed Lending:** Phase out directed and preferential lending practices
10. **Privatization:** Accelerate privatization of state-owned financial institutions

The authorities are implementing these FSAP recommendations as a priority, recognizing that financial sector development is critical for sustainable, private sector-led growth.

## 10. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 10.1 Macroeconomic and External Risks

**Table 17: Key Downside Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Description and Implications |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| **Prolonged Trade Policy Shocks and Global Trade Uncertainty** | Medium-High | High | Elevated global trade policy uncertainty and potential tariffs could reduce export demand, disrupt supply chains, and slow WTO accession benefits. Double landlocked geography amplifies vulnerability. |
| **Volatile and Unfavorable Commodity Prices** | Medium | High | Exposure to gold, cotton, natural gas, copper prices. Volatility impacts export revenues and fiscal position. Gold price procyclical spending would undermine inflation control. |
| **Tighter External Financing Conditions** | Medium | High | Shifts in global risk sentiment could reduce capital inflows, increase borrowing costs, strain PPP financing. Sub-investment grade ratings create vulnerability. |
| **Weaker External Demand from Trading Partners** | Medium | Medium-High | Slower growth in Russia, China, EU would reduce export growth and remittance inflows. Russia particularly important for remittances. |
| **Regional Geopolitical Tensions** | Medium | Medium | Security concerns or regional tensions could disrupt trade, reduce investor confidence, impact regional connectivity projects (CKU railway). |
| **Climate-Related Risks** | Medium-High | High | Water stress, natural disasters, environmental degradation impacting agriculture (20.6% of GDP) and productivity. Climate adaptation critical. |

### 10.2 Fiscal and Contingent Liability Risks

|---------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| **Contingent Liabilities from PPPs** | Medium | High | PPP portfolio ~27% of GDP (USD 31bn) with potential commitments up to 34% GDP. Materialization would require fiscal support, strain debt sustainability. FRAD monitoring critical. |
| **Contingent Liabilities from SOEs** | Medium | High | SOE financial distress potentially requiring government support. State bank exposures to SOEs create financial sector linkages. SOE reform and privatization urgent. |
| **Contingent Liabilities from State Banks** | Medium | Medium-High | State-owned commercial banks may require government support if asset quality deteriorates or capital needs arise. Banking sector supervision strengthening essential. |

**DSA Risk Rating:** Moderate. Debt assessed as sustainable with moderate risks. Public debt moderate at approximately 33% of GDP. However, contingent liabilities from PPPs (27% GDP) and SOEs add significantly to fiscal risks. External debt 54-56% of GDP manageable but requires monitoring.

**Gross Financing Needs:** Characterized as manageable. External financing needs met through mix of multilateral lending, bilateral support, and emerging market access as ratings improve.

**Stress Test Vulnerabilities:**
- Commodity price shocks (gold, cotton, gas exports)
- Tighter external financing increasing borrowing costs
- Contingent liability materialization from PPPs/SOEs
- Slower growth from reform delays
- Exchange rate depreciation impacting external debt servicing

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Moderate baseline debt levels (33% of GDP public debt)
- Strong multilateral support providing financing buffers
- Continued reform commitment supporting growth and credibility
- Fiscal consolidation path reducing deficits
- Ample international reserves (9.2 months imports)

### 10.3 Structural and Reform Risks

**Table 19: Structural and Reform Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Description and Implications |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| **Slower Pace of Structural Reforms** | Medium | High | Political economy constraints or implementation capacity issues could slow reforms, undermining growth prospects and investor confidence. Reform momentum critical to maintain. |
| **SOE Reform Delays** | Medium-High | Medium-High | Resistance to privatization or governance reforms could perpetuate inefficiencies, fiscal risks, market distortions. Accelerated reform needed. |
| **WTO Accession Delays** | Medium | Medium | Delays in completing WTO accession would slow trade integration, reduce reform pressure, limit market access benefits. |
| **Governance Challenges** | Medium-High | Medium | Remaining corruption issues (ranked 121/180 TI CPI 2024), judicial independence weaknesses, transparency gaps could deter FDI despite improvements. |

### 10.4 Financial Sector Risks

**Table 20: Financial Sector Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Description and Implications |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| **Banking Sector Stress from Rapid Credit Growth** | Medium | Medium-High | Credit growth volatility (21-23% in 2022-2023, then 4% in 2024, projected 19% in 2025) creates asset quality risks. Supervision strengthening per FSAP critical. |
| **Deteriorating Asset Quality** | Medium | Medium-High | NPL reporting needs strengthening. Rapid microcredit growth posing particular risks. Additional macroprudential measures needed. |
| **SOE/SOCB-Related Exposures** | Medium-High | High | State bank exposures to SOEs create concentrated risks. Directed lending being phased out but legacy exposures remain. Commercial orientation and privatization urgent. |
| **Limited Hedging Markets** | Medium | Medium | Shallow local currency hedging market creates FX risk for domestic currency financing. Major projects typically USD-denominated, creating currency mismatches for some borrowers. |

**Financial Sector Soundness:** Overall, banking sector remains well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable. However, the FSAP identified multiple areas requiring strengthening, and authorities are implementing recommendations as a priority.

### 10.5 Social and Political Risks

**Table 21: Social and Political Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Description and Implications |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| **Social Tensions from Inequality, Unemployment, or Reform Fatigue** | Medium | Medium | Youth unemployment 13.8%; female labor force participation 40% (low); regional disparities; poverty 8.9% despite improvement. Social cohesion important for reform momentum. |
| **Skills Mismatches and Youth Unemployment** | High | Medium | ~500,000 annual new labor market entrants; youth unemployment elevated; skills mismatches. Job creation and training critical for social stability and growth. |
| **Regional Economic Disparities** | Medium-High | Medium | Economic gaps between Tashkent and other regions; rural poverty; uneven development. Regional development initiatives needed. |

**Political Risk Assessment:** Moderate and improving. Political support for reforms is strong, with President Mirziyoyev re-elected 2021, Parliament 2024 elections supporting reform agenda, and Development Strategy 2022-2026 providing medium-term framework.

**However, risks include:**
- Political economy constraints and limited government capacity hindering complex reforms

- Female labor force participation 40% (low)
- Regional disparities
- Informality

**Social Progress:**
- Violence against women criminalized
- Gender inclusion initiatives
- Women in Business programmes
- Forced/child labor in cotton abolished (enabling EU GSP+ access)
- Development Strategy 2022-2026 Priority 4 focuses on social sphere and human capital

**E&S Risk Assessment:** Moderate. Environmental and social frameworks are improving but require continued attention, especially water management, climate adaptation, and social inclusion. EBRD and IFIs apply Environmental and Social standards to financed projects, supporting best practice adoption.

## 11. FINANCING LANDSCAPE

### 11.1 Multilateral Development Bank Engagement

Uzbekistan benefits from strong engagement with multiple multilateral development banks, providing financing, technical assistance, and policy dialogue support.

**Table 22: Multilateral Development Bank Portfolio**

| Institution | Portfolio/Commitment | Focus Areas | Recent Projects |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **EBRD** | EUR 2,379m portfolio (Dec 2023); 81 active projects; 59.3% private sector share | Financial institutions (EUR 380m SME credit lines to 9 PFIs); Infrastructure (NavoiTransmission EUR 71m, renewable energy, water); Private sector direct (Anglesey Food USD 40m, Meros Pharm USD 15m); Advisory (>230 SME projects, SOE governance TA) | Previous strategy (2018-2023) ABI EUR 3,290m; TC EUR 82.4m; Priority 1 (private sector) 49%, Priority 2 (green) 32%, Priority 3 (governance/connectivity) 19% |
| **World Bank** | Major partner | Infrastructure, development programs, PPP support, Benchmarking Infrastructure reports, policy-based lending | Toll road PPP advisory (Tashkent-Andijan, Tashkent-Samarkand); connectivity studies; governance reforms |
| **ADB** | Major partner | Infrastructure, policy lending, capacity building | Multiple infrastructure projects across sectors |
| **AIIB** | USD 100m (2025) | Digital infrastructure | Uzbekistan Telecom project |
| **IFC** | Selective | Project finance, equity investments | Limited but growing engagement |
| **Islamic Development Bank** | Bilateral financing | Various sectors | Concessional and market-based lending |

**PPP Project Development Facility (UPDF):** EBRD approved EUR 10 million contribution supporting early-stage feasibility studies and transaction advisory for PPP pipeline development.

**Total Multilateral Support:** Strong across financing, technical assistance, policy dialogue, capacity building, providing critical support for Uzbekistan's development and infrastructure agenda.

### 11.2 Bilateral Development Partners

**Bilateral Partners Include:**
- **AFD (Agence Française de Développement):** French development agency active in infrastructure
- **Expertise France:** Technical assistance and capacity building
- **Japan:** Bilateral loans and grants for infrastructure
- **Taipei China:** Development assistance
- **Luxembourg:** Smaller-scale technical cooperation

**Climate Finance:**
- **GCF (Green Climate Fund):** Climate adaptation and mitigation financing
- **EU Support:** Including EFSD (European Fund for Sustainable Development) for various initiatives

**Multilateral Coordination:** Strong coordination among multilateral and bilateral partners on PPP framework and capacity, financial sector reform, business climate, WTO accession, climate and green transition, infrastructure financing.

### 11.3 Sovereign Credit Profile and Market Access

**Sovereign Credit Ratings:**
- **Moody's:** Ba3 (stable outlook)
- **Standard & Poor's:** BB- (stable outlook)
- **Fitch:** BB (stable outlook)

These sub-investment grade but improving ratings reflect:
- **Positive Factors:** Reform progress, moderate debt levels, strong growth potential, demographic dividend, strategic location, natural resource base
- **Constraints:** Governance challenges (corruption 121/180), structural transformation incomplete, SOE dominance, PPP contingent liabilities, limited track record, double landlocked geography

**Rating Trajectory:** Stable outlooks across all three agencies indicate potential for upgrades if reforms continue and fiscal discipline maintained.

**Sovereign Issuance:** Uzbekistan has emerging market access. While no specific recent sovereign bond issuances are detailed in available excerpts, the credit ratings trajectory is positive, reflecting reform progress and supporting potential future issuance.

**PPP Program 2025-2030 Financing Needs:** The program envisages significant infrastructure financing needs, potentially requiring increased sovereign bond issuance in international markets as creditworthiness continues improving.

**Investor Base:** Growing international appetite as reforms deepen and ratings improve. Strong multilateral investor base provides foundation.

### 11.4 Commercial Bank Project Finance

**Banking Sector Capacity:** Credit growth has been strong (21-23% in 2022-2023), though with recent volatility. The banking sector is well-capitalized and profitable, but concentrated with state-owned commercial banks dominant.

**Project Finance Appetite:** Developing but limited track record. Large-scale infrastructure project finance typically requires international bank participation or IFI support.

**EBRD Credit Lines:** EUR 380 million provided to 9 Partner Financial Institutions (PFIs) during previous strategy for SME lending, demonstrating banking sector capacity but also need for wholesale funding support.

**State Bank Issues:** Directed and preferential lending through state-owned commercial banks continues, though being phased out per FSAP recommendations. Commercial banks increasingly active but large-scale infrastructure financing capacity limited.

**Microcredit Sector:** Expanding rapidly, creating both financial inclusion opportunities and risks warranting additional macroprudential measures.

### 11.5 FDI and Private Equity

**FDI Performance:** Significant increases since 2017 reforms, with major investments demonstrating growing international confidence.

**Major FDI Transactions:**

**Energy:**
- **Talimarjan Thermal Power Plant:** Mubadala Investment Company (40%) and TAQA Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (40%) acquired 80% stake for approximately USD 1.7 billion equivalent (2025) - landmark privatization with 25-year PPA

**Infrastructure:**
- **Tashkent-Andijan Toll Road:** More than 30 international companies expressed interest in RFQ (early 2025)

**Digital:**
- **TBC Bank:** Uzbekistan's first fully digital bank with international equity participation

**Retail:**
- **Anglesey Food:** USD 40 million EBRD equity investment in grocery retail chain

**Pharmaceuticals:**
- **Meros Pharm:** USD 15 million EBRD loan

**Renewable Energy:**
- International developers for 200MW solar PV (Navoi and Samarkand)
- 500MW wind power plant (Navoi) with international sponsors

**FDI Drivers:**
- Currency liberalization and full convertibility/repatriation (2017 reform)
- Large and growing domestic market (36.9 million population, 45% under 25)
- Strategic location for regional connectivity
- Natural resource base
- Labor cost competitiveness
- Trade liberalization and market access
- PPP framework and investment protections
- Tax incentives (corporate tax 15%, stability guarantees up to 10 years)

**FDI Constraints:**
- Governance challenges (corruption 121/180)
- Judicial system still developing
- SOE dominance creating uneven playing field
- Bureaucratic delays
- Double landlocked geography
- Skills mismatches

### 11.6 Capital Markets and Bond Financing

**Local Bond Market:** Underdeveloped and shallow. Capital Markets Development Strategy adopted 2021 with EBRD support, but implementation ongoing.

**Corporate Bond Market:** Nascent, with limited issuance and investor base.

**Municipal Bonds:** Underdeveloped, representing potential future financing channel for urban infrastructure.

**Development Priorities:**
- Regulatory framework enhancement
- Investor base development (domestic institutional investors)
- Market infrastructure (trading systems, clearance and settlement, custody)
- Credit rating and disclosure frameworks
- Corporate governance improvements

**Current Financing Pattern:** Major projects typically USD-denominated due to limited local currency hedging markets and shallow domestic capital markets. This creates currency mismatches for some borrowers but is necessary given market development stage.

### 11.7 Offtaker and Counterparty Credit Quality

**Sovereign Offtaker Credit:** Government offtaker arrangements (e.g., JSC Uzenergosotish for Talimarjan TPP 25-year PPA) provide payment security backed by sovereign credit (Moody's Ba3, S&P BB-, Fitch BB).

**Fiscal Position:** Moderate with public debt 33% of GDP, though PPP contingent liabilities 27% GDP create pressures requiring careful management.

**External Buffers:** International reserves ample at 9.2 months imports, providing external payment capacity.

**Government Commitment:** Development Strategy 2022-2026 demonstrates strong government commitment to strategic infrastructure, supporting credibility of long-term offtake agreements.

**SOE Credit Quality:** SOEs continue posing potential arrears issues. Gradual privatization underway (Talimarjan TPP 80% privatized). SOE reform strategy 2021-2025 adopted to improve governance and commercial orientation. State bank exposures to SOEs create financial sector linkages. FRAD monitors fiscal risks from SOEs. SOE financial discipline improving under reforms, but specific arrears data not provided.

**Toll Road Model:** Direct user-pay model for toll roads reduces offtaker risk, depending instead on traffic volume and ability/willingness to pay.

### 11.8 Currency and Hedging Constraints

**FX Convertibility Risk:** Low. Major reform achievement in 2017: full convertibility and repatriation, no capital controls, free floating exchange rate. International reserves ample. Overall very low convertibility risk.

**FX Volatility Risk:** Moderate. Exchange rate depreciation trend continuing (11,225 UZS/USD in 2022 to 12,920 in 2024). Real effective exchange rate also depreciating (61.8 in 2022 to 55.4 in 2024 on 2015=100 basis).

**Hedging Market Depth:** Limited. Local currency hedging instruments shallow. EBRD provided USD 20 million cross-currency swap for clients, but overall market limited. Major projects typically USD-denominated to avoid currency risk.

**Domestic Capital Markets:** Shallow, limiting domestic currency financing options. Capital Markets Development Strategy adopted 2021 but implementation ongoing.

**FX Liquidity:** For very large transactions, FX liquidity may face constraints despite overall convertibility.

**Implications for Project Finance:**
- USD-denominated financing typical for large projects
- Currency mismatch risks for projects with local currency revenues (tolls, tariffs)
- Hedging costs high where available
- Sovereign guarantees or exchange rate adjustment mechanisms in tariffs needed for bankability

### 13.5 Outlook

Uzbekistan's outlook is positive but conditional on continued reform implementation. The economy has demonstrated resilience and strong growth momentum. The government's commitment to reform, evidenced by the Development Strategy 2022-2026 and sustained engagement with multilateral partners, provides confidence in the trajectory.

**Positive Scenario:**
- GDP growth sustained at 5.5-6.0% medium-term
- Inflation declining to 5% target by end-2027
- Successful execution of major PPP projects (Tashkent-Andijan toll road, renewables)
- WTO accession completed
- SOE privatizations accelerated
- Governance improvements continuing
- Regional integration deepening (CKU railway completion)
- Climate finance mobilization for green transition
- Results: Investment grade credit ratings achieved medium-term; FDI sustained at high levels; infrastructure gaps addressed; private sector-led growth model established

**Downside Risks:**
- Reform momentum slows due to political economy constraints or capacity issues
- Commodity price shocks (gold, cotton, gas)
- External financing conditions tighten
- PPP contingent liabilities materialize requiring fiscal support
- Banking sector stress from rapid credit growth or SOE exposures
- Regional geopolitical tensions
- Climate shocks (water stress, natural disasters)
- Results: Growth slows; fiscal pressures intensify; investor confidence weakens; infrastructure gaps persist

**Most Likely Scenario:**

Gradual progress on reforms with uneven implementation, similar to the pattern observed 2018-2024 (stronger progress early period, slower later). Growth sustained at 5.5-6.0% medium-term supported by demographics, infrastructure investment, continued multilateral support. Inflation gradually declining but taking longer than targeted. Major PPP projects (toll roads, renewables) progress but with delays. SOE privatizations advance selectively. Governance improvements continue incrementally. Outcome: Uzbekistan remains emerging market investment opportunity with improving but still developing institutional frameworks; infrastructure sector offers opportunities but requires patient capital and strong risk management; multilateral involvement critical for successful project execution.
