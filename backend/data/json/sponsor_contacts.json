        "notes": "The meeting centered on strategic opportunities in data centres, solar, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), with a strong emphasis on renewable energy rather than AI infrastructure. John Choi expressed interest in developed markets such as Europe and Australia, citing political risk as a key concern in emerging regions. He was open to platform investment structures and discussed potential earn-out mechanisms, preferring percentage-based partnerships over fixed sums. Nav highlighted the importance of understanding cost of equity across different markets and stressed the need for strong sponsors and technical expertise, particularly in wind energy, which John viewed as too complex for OCI’s current capabilities. The conversation also touched on Meridian’s experience in Central and Eastern Europe, where John showed interest in reviewing case studies. A literature review was proposed to assess solar/BESS viability in target regions, including tariff structures. The meeting concluded with John planning to reflect over the coming weeks, keeping the scope focused and exploratory.",

        "notes": "Meridian is currently advising a South Korean sponsor on an AI data centre project and is exploring JV equity options. ORIX has been engaged since late 2022 via its IPF team and is now considering broader digital infrastructure exposure. ORIX’s platform spans IG to junior capital, with $250m committed and capacity for further trades.\nORIX expressed interest in a warehouse SPV structure, allowing co-investment and management control. They avoid greenfield risk and prefer sites with existing energy infrastructure. The Korean sponsor seeks direct risk access for underwriting, with a preference for IG tenants.\nSizing remains open. ORIX may have appetite for equity above $70m, which could support a larger securitisation. Meridian and ORIX discussed preparing bullet points to share with UK pension funds and other capital partners to facilitate quick feedback. ORIX offered to assist in drafting these.",
