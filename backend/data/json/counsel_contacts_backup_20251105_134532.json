        "notes": "The meeting focused on structuring the debt issuance for Phase 1 (Block 2) of a Mongolia-based power plant, with potential implications for Phase 2 (Blocks 3 and 4). Key topics included the treatment of seniority within the cash waterfall, the role of existing debt and liens under Mongolian regulations, and the feasibility of implementing partial paydowns. Discussions explored whether a pari passu structure would necessitate an inter-creditor agreement, and whether New York law might be preferable to English law. The team also debated the sufficiency of including terms in new bond documentation without existing lender consent, and the possibility of separating the new issuance from legacy debt. A critical point was the need to review original documentation to clarify prior agreements, waterfall mechanics, and security arrangements. Legal counsel from Mayer Brown participated in exploratory discussions, with local counsel confirmed on Meridian’s side.",
