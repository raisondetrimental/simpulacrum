They indicated a **max ~USD 15m** ticket, prefer **club-style** participation, and could introduce larger institutions (~USD 100m each) if the structure stacks up. They asked for **Singapore meetings** despite the HK track, and a focused **Investor Q&A** once materials are tightened. Commercially, **payments are timely**, effectively **power-for-cash daily** via NDC. Legally, this will be **Reg S (not 144A)** with documents expected to take **~4 weeks**, **counsel TBD**, and **closing timing still uncertain** pending documentation and scheduling.\n",

GMO, represented by Mustafa Ulukan, positioned itself as a long-term holder and flagged the call feature as a critical issue, stating that a standard high-yield call structure is non-negotiable and that they would likely be the largest investor. TME’s Ganjoloo Ochirpurev provided initial project context, while Meridian committed to updating the financial model to reflect semi-annual Yield to Call scenarios from Year 2 onwards, with callable prices at 104% and 102% in Years 2 and 3 respectively. Aijan requested Kush to implement these changes post-call. The meeting confirmed alignment on long-term investor expectations and flagged the need for further sponsor-side detail.\n",

John Choi expressed interest in developed markets such as Europe and Australia, citing political risk as a key concern in emerging regions. He was open to platform investment structures and discussed potential earn-out mechanisms, preferring percentage-based partnerships over fixed sums. Nav highlighted the importance of understanding cost of equity across different markets and stressed the need for strong sponsors and technical expertise, particularly in wind energy, which John viewed as too complex for OCI’s current capabilities. The conversation also touched on Meridian’s experience in Central and Eastern Europe, where John showed interest in reviewing case studies. A literature review was proposed to assess solar/BESS viability in target regions, including tariff structures. The meeting concluded with John planning to reflect over the coming weeks, keeping the scope focused and exploratory.",

They avoid greenfield risk and prefer sites with existing energy infrastructure. The Korean sponsor seeks direct risk access for underwriting, with a preference for IG tenants.\nSizing remains open. ORIX may have appetite for equity above $70m, which could support a larger securitisation.

Key topics included the treatment of seniority within the cash waterfall, the role of existing debt and liens under Mongolian regulations, and the feasibility of implementing partial paydowns. Discussions explored whether a pari passu structure would necessitate an inter-creditor agreement, and whether New York law might be preferable to English law. The team also debated the sufficiency of including terms in new bond documentation without existing lender consent, and the possibility of separating the new issuance from legacy debt. A critical point was the need to review original documentation to clarify prior agreements, waterfall mechanics, and security arrangements. Legal counsel from Mayer Brown participated in exploratory discussions, with local counsel confirmed on Meridian’s side.",
